Summary
We analyzed 15 schools, which are categorized into 2 types: district and charter. Each school has its budget allocations as well as different math and reading scores. Based on the analysis:
 
1.	 Charter schools exhibit the highest rate of performance in math score, reading score, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing. Conversely, district schools demonstrate the lowest rate of performance.
 
2.	Students who attend schools with a budget allocation of less than $585 showcase the best performance in math, reading, and overall passing.

3.	Schools with a smaller student population display the highest performance in math, reading, and overall passing rates.
